# Earthquake Data Visualization

Eartquake Data Visualization is a java code made in processing that visualizes data taken from online based on where it was(longitude x latitude) and the magnitude of damage it had done.

The data is visualized through the use of multiple circles. The circles size and color is determined by the magnitude of the earthquake, and the circles location is determined by its location in the real world. The left and right arrow keys can be used to traverse the map, and to explore earthquakes around the world.

There are two classes, one is the circle that is used to represent an earthquake, called: dataCircle.pde, and the second is the main class that creates the array of circles and displays them onto the map, called: dataVisaulization.pde.

*Hovering over a circle will display its information: country, location(longitude and latitude), and magnitude*
